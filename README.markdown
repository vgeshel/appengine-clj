# Clojure library for Google App Engine

This library is a Clojure API for [Google App
Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine). It is based on John Hume's
[appengine-clj](http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj) and has
some enhancements. It is heavily refactored, so don't expect
compatibility with the original library.

### Documentation 

The [Autodoc](http://tomfaulhaber.github.com/autodoc) API documentation can be found
[here](http://r0man.github.com/appengine-clj).

### Install

[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) usage:
    [appengine "0.2"]

### appengine.datastore.core

A convenience API for the
[com.google.appengine.api.datastore](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-tree.html)
package providing access to Google's schema-free datastore. It allows
you to work with immutable data structures instead of mutable Entity
instances.

Example:
    (create-entity {:kind "continent" :name "Europe"})
    => {:kind "continent" :key #<Key Person(1138)> :name "Europe"}

### appengine.datastore.entities

A convenience API for the appengine.datastore namespace. Entity helper
functions can be generated with the <code>defentity</code> macro.

Examples:

    (defentity continent ()
      (iso-3166-alpha-2 :key true)
      (name))
     
    (defentity country (continent)
      (iso-3166-alpha-2 :key true)
      (iso-3166-alpha-3)
      (name))
     
    (defentity region (country)
      (code :key true)
      (name))
     
    (with-local-datastore
      (let [continent (create-continent {:name "Europe" :iso-3166-alpha-2 "eu"})
            country (create-country continent {:name "Spain" :iso-3166-alpha-2 "es"})
            region (create-region country {:name "Galicia" :code "SP58"})]
        (println continent)
        (println country)
        (println region)))
     
    ; this prints: 
     
    {:name Europe, :iso-3166-alpha-2 eu, :kind continent, :key #&lt;Key continent("eu")&gt;}
    {:name Spain, :iso-3166-alpha-2 es, :kind country, :key #&lt;Key continent("eu")/country("es")&gt;}
    {:code SP58, :name Galicia, :kind region, :key #&lt;Key continent("eu")/country("es")/region("SP58")&gt;}

### appengine.datastore.transactions

Transaction and retry support based on AppEngine semantics (see [DatastoreService low-level API for details](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/DatastoreService.html)).

<code>(with-transaction ...)</code> executes its body in a transaction.  In case of a DatastoreFailureException or a ConcurrentModificationException, the body's execution is retried *transaction-retries* times.  Beware that if the retry-count is reached and an exception is thrown within the body of the transaction, the transaction is thrown out of the <code>(with-transaction...)</code>.

The transaction functionality works with both appengine.datastore.core and appengine.datastore.entities.

Examples:
    ;; Either creates both entities or neither if too many datastore exceptions.
    ;; Returns the second entity, as expected.
    (with-transaction
      (let [parent (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "jane"})]
        (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "bob" 
                     :parent-key (:key parent)})))
     
    ;; You can set the number of retries to deviate from the default (4)
    (with-retries 2 (with-transaction ... ))

Transactions automatically rollback as per the low-level API specs.  Additionally, appengine-clj supports manual rollback using <code>(rollback-transaction)</code>.  Within a <code>(with-transaction ...)</code>, you may check whether the current transaction is active through <code>(is-transaction-active?)</code>.  These can be used together to get consistent snapshots of parts of the datastore.

    (with-transaction
      ...
      (if (and something-went-wrong (is-transaction-active?))
        (rollback-transaction)))

You can nest transactions when working with two entity groups, but each transaction's success is independent of the other.

    (with-transaction ;; group1
      (let [parent-group1 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "jane"})
            child-group1 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Child" :name "tamara"
                   		       	:parent-key (:key parent-group1)})]
        (with-transaction ;; nested group2
          (let [parent-group2 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "berni"})
                child-group2 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Child" :name "eric"
                   		       	:parent-key (:key parent-group2)})]
            ...
      ))))

You can execute datastore operations outside of the current transaction through <code>(without-transaction)</code>.  Note: <code>(without-transaction)</code> has no retry semantics and should typically be surrounded by a (try ... (catch ...)) so that errors do not affect the surrounding transaction.

    (with-transaction
      ...
      (try {
        (without-transaction 
          (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "andy"}))
        (catch ...))
      ...
    )

### appengine.memcache

A convenience API for the [com.google.appengine.api.memcache](http://code.google.com/intl/ja/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/memcache/package-tree.html) package providing access to Google's memcache.

Example:
    (put-value "name" "Monkey D. Luffy") ;; save value
    (get-value "name") ;;=> "Monkey D. Luffy"
    (delete-value "name")
    
    ;; with Expiretaion
    (put-value "bounty" 100000000 3600) ;; expire after 1h
    (put-value "bounty" 100000000 (Date. 2010 10 3)) ;; specify expire date
    
    ;; with Policy
    (add-value "ability" "GomGom") ;; add only if not present
    (replace-value "bounty" 300000000) ;; replace only if present
    (set-value "sex" "male") ;; set always (same as put-value)
    
    ;; inc/dec value
    (put-value "member-count" 8)
    (inc-value "member-count") ;;=> 9
    (dec-value "member-count") ;;=> 8
    (inc-value "member-count" 10) ;;=> 18

### appengine.urlfetch

A convenience API for the [com.google.appengine.api.urlfetch](http://code.google.com/intl/ja/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/urlfetch/package-tree.html) package.

Example:
    (def *url* "http://www.google.com/")
    (fetch *url*)
    
    ; This returns response as map.
    {:status-code 200,
     :headers {:Content-Type "text/html; charset=utf-8",...}
     :content "<html>..."}
     
    ; fetch with options
    (fetch *url* {:method "POST", :follow-redirects false})
    
Supported Options:

* method (<code>"GET"</code> by default)
* payload
* headers
* allow-truncate
* follow-redirects (<code>true</code> by default)

### appengine.users

Convenience API for the
[com.google.appengine.api.users](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-tree.html)
package.

The <code>user-info</code> function can be called from anywhere to get
the current user and a UserService.  For a more functional approach, a
Ring middlware function is provided to assoc the user info into every
request under the key :appengine-clj/user-info.

### appengine.test

Provides setup and teardown of a local service for use in tests or
from a REPL. If you're using <code>clojure.test</code>, you can use
the usefull macros(<code>datastore-test</code>,
<code>memcache-test</code>, <code>urlfetch-test</code>) to get a fresh
environment for each test.
