# Clojure library for Google App Engine


This library is a Clojure API for [Google App
Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine). It is based on John Hume's
[appengine-clj](http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj) and has
some enhancements. It is heavily refactored, so don't expect
compatibility with the original library.

### appengine.datastore.core

A convenience API for the
[com.google.appengine.api.datastore](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-tree.html)
package providing access to Google's schema-free datastore. It allows
you to work with immutable data structures instead of mutable Entity
instances.

Example:

<pre><code>
(create-entity {:kind "continent" :name "Europe"})
=> {:kind "country" :key #<Key Person(1138)> :name "Europe"}
</code></pre>

### appengine.datastore.entities

A convenience API for the appengine.datastore namespace. Entity helper
functions can be generated with the <code>defentity</code> macro.

Examples:

<pre><code>

(defentity continent ()
  (iso-3166-alpha-2 :key true)
  (name))

(defentity country (continent)
  (iso-3166-alpha-2 :key true)
  (iso-3166-alpha-3)
  (name))

(defentity region (country)
  (code :key true)
  (name))

(with-local-datastore
  (let [continent (create-continent {:name "Europe" :iso-3166-alpha-2 "eu"})
        country (create-country continent {:name "Spain" :iso-3166-alpha-2 "es"})
        region (create-region country {:name "Galicia" :code "SP58"})]
    (println continent)
    (println country)
    (println region)))

; this prints: 

{:name Europe, :iso-3166-alpha-2 eu, :kind continent, :key #<Key continent("eu")>}
{:name Spain, :iso-3166-alpha-2 es, :parent-key #<Key continent("eu")>, :kind country, :key #<Key continent("eu")/country("es")>}
{:code SP58, :name Galicia, :parent-key #<Key continent("eu")/country("es")>, :kind region, :key #<Key continent("eu")/country("es")/region("SP58")>}

</code></pre>

### appengine.datastore.transactions

Transaction and retry support based on AppEngine semantics (see [DatastoreService low-level API for details](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/DatastoreService.html)).

<code>(with-transaction ...)</code> executes its body in a transaction.  In case of a DatastoreFailureException or a ConcurrentModificationException, the body's execution is retried *transaction-retries* times.  Beware that if the retry-count is reached and an exception is thrown within the body of the transaction, the transaction is thrown out of the <code>(with-transaction...)</code>.

The transaction functionality works with both appengine.datastore.core and appengine.datastore.entities.

Examples:

<pre><code>;; Either creates both entities or neither if too many datastore exceptions.
;; Returns the second entity, as expected.
(with-transaction
  (let [parent (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "jane"})]
    (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "bob" 
	               :parent-key (:key parent)})))

;; You can set the number of retries to deviate from the default (4)
(with-retries 2 (with-transaction ... ))</code></pre>

Transactions automatically rollback as per the low-level API specs.  Additionally, appengine-clj supports manual rollback using <code>(rollback-transaction)</code>.  Within a <code>(with-transaction ...)</code>, you may check whether the current transaction is active through <code>(is-transaction-active?)</code>.  These can be used together to get consistent snapshots of parts of the datastore.

<pre><code>(with-transaction
  ...
  (if (and something-went-wrong (is-transaction-active?))
    (rollback-transaction)))</code></pre>

You can nest transactions when working with two entity groups, but each transaction's success is independent of the other.

<pre><code>(with-transaction ;; group1
  (let [parent-group1 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "jane"})
        child-group1 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Child" :name "tamara"
	             		       	:parent-key (:key parent-group1)})]
    (with-transaction ;; nested group2
      (let [parent-group2 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "berni"})
            child-group2 (ds/create-entity {:kind "Child" :name "eric"
	             		       	:parent-key (:key parent-group2)})]
        ...
	))))</code></pre>

You can execute datastore operations outside of the current transaction through <code>(without-transaction)</code>.  Note: <code>(without-transaction)</code> has no retry semantics and should typically be surrounded by a (try ... (catch ...)) so that errors do not affect the surrounding transaction.

<pre><code>(with-transaction
  ...
  (try {
    (without-transaction 
      (ds/create-entity {:kind "Person" :name "andy"}))
    (catch ...))
  ...
)</code></pre>

### appengine.users

Convenience API for the
[com.google.appengine.api.users](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/index.html?com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-tree.html)
package.

The <code>user-info</code> function can be called from anywhere to get
the current user and a UserService.  For a more functional approach, a
Ring middlware function is provided to assoc the user info into every
request under the key :appengine-clj/user-info.



### appengine.test-utils

Provides setup and teardown of an in-memory Datastore for use in tests
or from a REPL.  If you're using <code>clojure.contrib.test-is</code>,
you can use the <code>dstest</code> macro to get a fresh Datastore for
each test.
